# Integration Testing with Selenium

This repository is dedicated to integration testing using **Selenium**, a powerful tool for automating web browsers. Selenium allows you to write scripts in various programming languages (like Java, Python, C#, etc.) to simulate user interactions with web applications, ensuring functionality and reliability.

## Key Features of Selenium

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test your web applications on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- **Multi-Language Support**: Write tests in languages like Java, Python, Ruby, and more.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrate Selenium tests into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines.
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel to save time.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebharathi/integration-testing-v2.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install Selenium WebDriver for your preferred language (e.g., `pip install selenium` for Python).
   - Download the appropriate browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).

3. **Write Your Tests**:
   - Create test scripts to automate interactions with your web application.

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute your scripts and analyze the results.

## Example (Python)
```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open a webpage
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Perform actions (e.g., click a button)
button = driver.find_element_by_id("submit")
button.click()

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```
